## Hi there 👋, I'm Laith.

- I'm currently in high school learning Mathematics with CS.

There is nothing more to talk about me really, I like to keep a low profile and do what I love, coding 😊
I've a lot of unfinished projects I never even committed to GitHub. Honesty, I don't have a purpose yet...
Just letting my imagination take control. Trying to find who I am.

I have experience in,
- C/C++
- C#
- Java
- Rust
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Python
- SQL (if you take that as a language)
- React, Django, Svelte, etc (framework-ish things)

For the record, I don't have any certificates to prove I've learned them. I learned them just because I want to 🤷‍♂️, just because I can 😎. (Online self-learning materials)
